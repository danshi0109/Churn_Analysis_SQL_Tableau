# Bank Customer Churn Analysis ( SQL & PowerBI )
## Background

Customer Churn is a critical issue for many companies, where customers discontinue their service or switch to another provider. Even small, tiny increases in churn rate (%) can quickly have a major negative effect on a company's profits. Because a higher churn rate leads to a higher Customer acquisition cost (CAC) and reduced company's revenue. Actually, acquiring new customers is much more expensive than maintaining existing customer relationships. 

This Dataset is from Kaggle that consists of 10,000 customers mentioning their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. There are nearly 18 features. From a Data Analyst aspects, analysing a new industry and learning new analysis technologies are indispensable. So aftering researching in Bank industry and Churn Analysis, I would like to answer these questions by conducting Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) in Microsoft SQL Server and visualise my insights in PowerBI.

- Is the bank losing high value customers? If so, how can they retain them?
