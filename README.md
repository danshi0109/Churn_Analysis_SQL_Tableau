# Maven Telecom Customer Churn Analysis(SQL&Tableau)
## Background

Customer Churn is a critical issue for many companies, where customers discontinue their service or switch to another provider. Even small, tiny increases in churn rate (%) can quickly have a major negative effect on a company's profits. Because a higher churn rate leads to a higher Customer acquisition cost (CAC) and reduced company's revenue. Actually, acquiring new customers is much more expensive than maintaining existing customer relationships. 

I would like to conduct customer churn analysis for Maven Telecommunications company that provides phone and internet services to 7,043 customers in California, and includes details about customer demographics, location, services, and current status. From a Data Analyst aspects, aftering researching in Telecom industry and Churn Analysis, I would like to answer these questions by coding in Microsoft SQL Server and visualise the insights in Tableau. 

Trying to figure out questions:
- What seem to be the key drivers of customer churn?
